Most of the pictures of the Oslo bomber and Utoya killer Anders Behring Breivik on the Internet are his own. 

We don't want to let him have his "idol pictures" be spread over the Internet. Therefore we have made the decision to foul the search engines to show some other shit instead.

Therefore, please make a post about Anders Behring Breivik in your blog and use one of these pictures as photo of him.

Here's the Swedish blog post starting this idea:
